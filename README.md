# CSGO INTERNAL BASE
All of this code is very bad, which is why it's freely available. I started this project to learn more about reverse engineering and more in-depth C++. My newer projects are private.

Re-uploaded in 2021 because there was sensitive information in one of the older commits, and the easiest way to hide it was to delete/reupload the whole repository.
